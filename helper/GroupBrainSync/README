Usage
========================================

GroupBrainSync supports direct computation on data matrix or a list of file names with a data loading function when memory is limited.

[Y, O] = groupBrainSync(data, option);

    data
        A 3D numerical data with a size of T x V x S. where T is the number of time points, V is the number of voxels/vertices, and S is the number of subjects. Or a cell list of file names that will be passed to dataLoadingFunc below to read each subject data.

    option
        A option struct with the following fields.

    	option.isDataMatrix:
    		A binary flag indicating if the provided data is a matrix or a list of file names. Default is true.

        option.dataLoadingFunc:
            The function handle to load data from the files, only used when isDataMatrix is false.

        option.batchSize:
        	The number of subjects to be processed in each batch, only used when isDataMatrix is false.

        option.numCPU:
        	The number of CPU used when parallel computing is available, default is 0 for single thread computation.
        
        option.epsX:
        	The convergence criterion, default is 1e-3.

        option.isVerbose
            The verbose binary flag to report progress during computation, default is true.


    Y
        The virtual subject
    O
        The transforms that synchronize subjects to Y

Default options can be obtained by calling groupBrainSync without any inputs.
    option = groupBrainSync();
